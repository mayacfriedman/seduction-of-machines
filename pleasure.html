  <h3>Personal Computers Are Now The  <br>
  Newest “Equipment” Used in BDSM
</h3>

  <h2>PJ: So I think all you need to know is that Mistress Harley says that the first time she encountered this fetish was a few years ago and she had just been like going about her normal life as an online dominatrix.
  <br>
HARLEY: I was doing kind of your typical pro domme sessions which look like Skype sessions you know, where you're dominating someone via cam. Um, and people started to ask me if I could dominate their computers.
<br>
SRUTHI: Are the- is that the words they use, like dominate my computer?
<br>
HARLEY: Yeah. Dominate my computer, take over my computer, lock down my computer, install parental controls on my computer. These were the kind of requests I was starting to get. To take remote control of people’s devices in order to dominate them in a BDSM context.
</h2>
<p>
  Driving home one afternoon, this was a conversation I heard featured on the podcast​ Reply All in an episode titled “Trust the Process.” This particular episode interviews online dominatrix, Mistress Harley, who shares stories about “the rising percentage of her clientate [requesting] that she dominate their computers.” She brands herself as the “first, and only techdomme.” “​I realized [clients] would just GIVE me money when they realized that I was a dominant cruel woman who would take total control of their computers and their entire digital lives!” (cite)​ After a quick search, I stumbled upon an NYU student, ​Ziyu He, ​who had similarly found this podcast, and driven by the same zealous curiosity to try and understand the motivation behind this emerging online behavior, coded a cyber dominatrix to experience the process on her own device. While Mistress Harley and her clientele are perhaps the most head-turning iteration of this curious relationship to technology, it is one of a series of emerging anecdotes ​where technology not only mediates pleasure but becomes the object of pleasure and intimacy itself. While Ziyu He argues that our virtual possessions become an extension of the self and as a result explains why we can experience pleasure from the manipulation of our computers, I
would argue that this fetish is a larger consequence of the corporate design of technology devices that have ​commodified the corporeal and psychological sensensations of pleasure through the purposeful design of intimacy between users and their products. Frequent critics have chidded big tech’s use of design inclusive of “behavioristic conditioning to produce insatiability [and] addiction,” but rather it’s time to turn the conversation to the fact that large-scale information technology companies have not only cheapened “like” and “love,” but they have also cheapened ''pleasure” and ''intimacy” ​by relying on design decisions that ​lead our physical bodies to react to our tangible technologies so intensely and sensually. Quoting the words of Sherry Turkle​, ​Mistress Harley’s clients have experienced ​“​the seductions of intimate machines,”​ in a very literal sense (cite).​ As such, I have to ask: What are the overarching values of the technological design industry that have led to this​ intimacy-driven-desire​ towards our machines. What are the consequences of this type of design? ​And should we do about it?!

  <h3>The War Between Cheap Pleasure & <br>
     Real Pleasure in Technology Design<br>
</h3>

  <h2> “Sex has become one of the forces shaping information technology.” -  <i>Frederick E. Allen, Why Sex Drives Technological Innovation </i> </h2>
<div>
  <p>
    <img src="images/pleasure3.gif" class="left">
    <b>Why is this conversation important ​right now​? </b> Ultimately, what is problematic about big tech’s use of pleasure as a design tool to is what I’m referring to as the “cheapening of pleasure.” By this I mean, isolating the physiological response to a pleasurable experience (i.e. the chemical release of dopamine) from pleasure’s political and emotional context, which is tied to a history of gender and sexual orientation inequality, capitalism and taboo. ​Amidst big tech’s exploitation of our natural pleasure response in the design of their experiences, their hypocritical, strict policies stand firm against advertising or outwardly discussing sexual pleasure on most of their platforms. Companies such as Google and Facebook do not allow any form of advertisements related to sex or sexuality. Even further, Facebook is explicit in its disregard for pleasure. It prohibits “ads [that] promote the sale or use of adult products or services, except for ads for
 family planning and contraception. Ads for contraceptives must focus on the contraceptive features of the product, and not on sexual pleasure or sexual enhancement, and must be targeted to people 18 years or older.” ​As of late, these policies are being publically called out in a “pleasure war” that has ​erupted between large technology companies, who by and large have a fairly closed-minded view around sexuality and pleasure, and a new crop of sex technology companies who are attempting to create a renwewed approach to design to change narratives about pleasure. <br>
 <br>
This new crop of sex technologies on the other side of the “pleasure war” have slowly and swiftly moved into cultural and economic consciousness with a renewed presence, playing a role in dismantling the pleasure taboos that exist in the West. Technology-driven sex toys are getting steep press, espcially after female-funded sex toy company Lori DeCarlo had its innovation award revoked due to CES’s questionable invocation of the ineligibility caluse. The Consumer Electronics show also “announced that next year's show will have a new product category: Sex Tech” (cite). While sex technology is not new at CES, it is the first year of recognition as its own category. The global sex toys market is predicted to grow by USD 9.92 billion from 2019 to 2023 (Global Sex Toy Market Report), characterized by an epic recalibration of the pleasure business. There’s also been an increase in female-run sex toy businesses and pornography entrepreneurs that “emphasize stocking quality products and offering attentive customer service” and “technologies that offer sex education, intimacy skills and gender identity.”
[Need to add more on the history of technology and pleasure - needs work and re-organization - not 100% where this will go]​. <br>
<br>
Amidst this pleasure war, it’s important to call out the relationship between technology, intimacy and pleasure is not new. In fact, this history is so rich, the choice

to approach this topic as a segment of a paper is a failed effort at best. ​Hallie Lieberman, holder of the world’s first PhD in the history of sex toys, famously pointed out that the first “technology” as related to desire was discovered ​30,000 years ago​ when “our ancestors had been hunched over carving eight-inch-long penises out of siltstone.” (cite) To this day, scholars continue to hold chicken-or-egg debates around the influence on pleasure of technology and vice versa. [​techno-deterministic versus social-deterministic attitudes about the relationship between pleasure and technology.]​ Ellis Hanson notes “with the development of digital imaging, communication, data storage, and medical technology, there have been radical shifts in the way we experience, represent, and theorize about sexuality and desire” (cite) while others argue that sex (and war) are two of the biggest drivers in the creation and diseemination of information technologies.

  <h3>First Comes Intimacy,<br>
     Then Comes Pleasure <br>
</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>"Intimacy is hypothesized to serve both as a trigger for sexual desire and as a reward resulting from the experience of sexual arousal and—in particular—of orgasm." -​<i> The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</i>​ </h2>
</div>
<div>
  <img src="images/pleasure1.gif" class="center">
  <p> <strong>So, what design decisions by big tech are driving this intimacy-driven-desire towards our everyday machines? </strong> ​In the ​Journal of Social and Personal Relationships​, research has shown that for both men and women in long-term relationships “the experience of emotional intimacy plays a particularly large role in [triggering] sexual desire.” So, it’s helpful to consider the role of intimacy as related to our everyday technologies to further unpack the underlying drivers behind the desire for the manipulation of our computers and digital lives. Let’s take the laptop for example, a considerable long-term “partnership” that much of the Western world has taken part in. ​Holly Herndon, one of many artists and scholars that has begun to expose ​how sensual and intimate the relationship is between users and their everyday technologies puts it best. ​She
 describes the laptop as ​“the most intimate instrument that we’ve ever seen. It’s a surface that’s as familiar as our own flesh, a thing that we entrust with our secrets and memories, a machine that we fall asleep cradling” (cite)​. <br>
 <br>
One proposed explanation for the high level of intimacy and positive feelings we associate with our devices is our ability to operate these tools without conscious thought as if [they] were a part of our bodies. Scholar George Bastille writes, some “technologies have certain qualities that allow them to disappear from consciousness through use, that is, by becoming transparent or intimately connected. This intimacy implies a user ignorant of the inner components and manufacturing process, but entirely familiar with use. With total familiarity, technological objects recede into the background of consciousness and become nothing, but extensions of our body” (cite).<br>
<br>
The definition of intimacy and technology as put forth by Bastille is a direct correlation to the ubiquitous western corporate design mantra of making everything increasingly frictionless, the goal of design to be for consumers to use digital devices without conscious thought. “A frictionless life is the tacit promise of many of the last decade’s most “disruptive” technologies, companies, longing for a sexy, seamless​ ​world” (cite), It is in fact this “sexy seamlessness” that I argue has allowed ubiquitous technologies like our iPhones and laptop computers to become our most intimate companions and subsequently objects of sexual desire. ​Sherry Turkle​ notes that “it’s not surprising that we project the possibility of love, surprise, amusement, and warmth onto our communication devices” (cite). Mistress Harley and her clientele are showing us that the intimate relationship we have with our products is also driving the projection of feelings of

sexual desire onto our everyday devices. ​[Need to add more about the history of designing “seamless, efficient, intuitive technology.]

<h3>The Device Caress<br>
</h3>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
“I​ am not sure about swiping, but there was always something intimate and also sexual about touching. Think of caressing. Think of how you caress your phone. Think of the intimate space that is created between the back of your screen and the curve of your palm.” - <i>Theo, Triantafyllidis, How to Everything </i> </h2>
</div>
<div>
<img src="images/pleasure2.gif" class="center">
<p> <strong>T​he pleasure that has been designed into our everyday communication technologies is not only psychological and physiological but material as well. </strong> ​Enter the mouse​, a crucial predecessor and informant to the now ubiquitous touch screen​.​ D​ esigned by Douglas Englebart and originally referred to as the “bug,” the mouse created to find new ways to control the computer, but more so “it [was] a computing device developed in [direct] relation to the body,” with a strong emphasis on tactility, materiality and visual metaphors.
<br>
<br>
Ali Na in the “The Fetish of the Click: A Small History of the Computer Mouse as Vulva,” shares her own thesis on the form and function of the mouse in an effort to highlight the ”importance of materiality and power embedded in an object.” She compares the computer mouse to “a vulva in form, with a likened curvature, a separation of click- able buttons (lips), and a rolling, silicone-soft clickable clitoris.” “The vulva mouse moves attention away from the port and to the intimacy of touching, entangled in fluid movements” stimulating a form of tech-driven pleasure. The vulva-metaphor has not been lost on designer Andy Kurovets, who later designed the “G-spot” mouse, shaped not-so-subtly like a vagina with the clitoris as the “scroll” button and the “g-spot” as quick access to the user’s favorites page. Furthermore, the sensations of touch and intimacy designed into the mouse have also been linked to its design “as constructed in a movement toward invisibility, toward an ergonomic and naturalized-prosthetic understanding of the mouse,” which further reifies the history of intimacy with our technologies as driven through the design of a frictionless and invisible relationship with our corporate technology products.
The mouse “a mundane object of everyday computing elevated to a fetish object with attachments to the genitalia of the other sex,” has ushered in a similar tactile, fetishezed relationship with our current touchscreen devices. The ​popularity of touchscreen derives in part from similar haptic pleasures that come from tapping and swiping the screens. However, the sensorimotor processes designed into the touch screen are far more muted than those designed into the mouse. “X” writes, “the touch that is designed into our devices has been continually reduced to “[screens] or [touch tablets] made of smooth material, which lacks of rich touch informatio​n” (cite) ​that the mouse had​. ​Instead, in order to design efficiency and usability without conscious effort, technology interfaces and devices have continued to lose all friction associated with interaction. This cheapening or muting of “tactile pleasure,” however, is purposeful for the benefit of allowing for machines who can “through a screen, read our body language.” Writer Amanda Greene notes, “​ou​ r corporeal feelings migrate into digital information through the ways we literally touch our devices and look at our screens, creating exhaustive records of our lives that run alongside the ones we intentionally curate on social media. Acknowledging that digital exhaust creates uncannily enduring affective archives can reframe how we think about this data — and show how profoundly intimate it really is” (cite). </p>

  <h3>Mistress Harley Has <br>
    Consent to Surveil
  </h3>

“​When technologies are disguised, or too easy to use, we forget their power. We lose track of how the logics and rhetorics of computing affect us.” <i> - Sylvia Tomayko-Peters, Sexual Interfaces </i> </h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The intimacy and pleasure curated through the design of our everyday technology products simulates​ a sense of control, but rather, ​it has altered our sense of criticality when interacting in the digital world. It has designed a false air of intimacy between users and their products, even
 to the extent of seeing their materiality as inherently being tied to sexual desire. Mistress Harley’s clientele show us that in search of pleasure, clients will give unfettered access to their most personal information and the consent to manipulate their computers and digital worlds freely. While it is assumed that Mistress Harley is not helping herself to her clients personal information, this relationship is a metaphor for the consequences of “cheapening” or misusing pleasure on​ grandeur scale. ​“W​ e willingly offer our personal photos, opinions, and other information, because of the great pleasure it gives us. We enjoy sharing our lives with friends and family, and social media platforms are set up to deliver fast and quantifiable ​feedback from our followers that fires our dopamine centers​” (cite). The deep intimacy between users and their devices has allowed corporate surveillance to pray on our vulnerability without providing users with the full look behind the curtain to understand the extent of this violation. In the case of the touch screen, we take the pleasurable sensations of swiping and scrolling at face value, rather than reminding each other that personal information and user data are generated from the rhythms of touch and minute body gestures we use in interacting with our everyday technologies. ​Ali Na warns against the idea of losing agency of understanding our technology as she writes about the move from mouse to touch screen. “It is important to avoid understanding this transition as one toward more direct or unmediated contact with the digital.” “The more direct the interface seems to ordinary users, the more likely they are to take it for granted and ignore how their experience is being mediated.” (cite)
 <br>
 <br>
Artist Holly Herndon’s Herndon refers to this violation of the intimacy and pleasure designed between us and our devices on her newest album PROTO, where​ “​she imagines a relationship with an N.S.A. officer who spies on her through her laptop” (cite). She writes,

“​The ongoing NSA revelations have fundamentally changed this relationship. I entrusted so much in my device. To learn this intimacy had been compromised felt like a grand betrayal” (cite.)
